## Topic: Traffic Crash in Grand Rapids Metropolitan Area,Michigan

I have imported the preprocessed data from https://github.com/Madankc71/STA518-Final-Project. In this git, I have developed shiny application which displays the interactive visualizations.

I have created three navbar menus in the shiny application.

The first one is an interactive bar chart. We have two 'select types' in the sidebar: a. Crash b. Injuries and death. When one of the 'select types' is selected, then the barchart of the selected type due to alcohol and drugs is seen in the bars for each year from 2004 to 2019.

In the second nav menu called ‘County’, when we select one county among four counties from the sidebar, the line charts due to alcohol and drugs can be visualized in two tabs in the main: 'Crashes' in left one and 'Injuries and Death' in the right one.

In the third nav menu called ‘Proportion’, I have implemented slider input from the sidebar from which we can select an input year by sliding a slider. When we select a year from the sidebar, then we can see a pie chart in the main menu that shows the percentage of total crashes in each county.
